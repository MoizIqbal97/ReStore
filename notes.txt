what is an entity framework


In the older days we would have to open a connection, excecute a command, read it and then map it from db to the object and then close the connection
with EF we dont have to do that anymore

It uses an Object/Relational Mapper to gets the enitity and writes the sql commands to run whatever it needs to do

The DbContext Class
provides a gateway to our db
responsible for managing our connection with the db
has dbset which represents tables inside our db

Uses LINQ queries
